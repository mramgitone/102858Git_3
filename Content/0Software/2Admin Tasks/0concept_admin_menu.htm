                <p>As the Helios controller can only acquire and process a single <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> sensor at a time, a device is used to sequentially connect each <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> to the Helios controller. This is known as an Optical Multiplexor.  Because each <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> sensor is different, it requires its own set of properties.  </p>
                <p>In addition to the multiple <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> sensors attached to a single Helios controller, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> has been extended to allow for simultaneous detection and awareness on multiple disturbance types.  This requires multiple process streams to alarm on multiple disturbance types.  There is a core set of properties that are defined for each Optical Channel. Additional process properties are defined for each Processing Stream used to satisfy the alarm event requirements.  </p>

                <h3><a name="Detectio"></a>Detection Statistics</h3>
                <p>This module is responsible for the pre-process of the raw power spectra data, in an attempt to maximize the SNR for a particular type, or class, of disturbance (See <MadCap:xref href="opchan_process_tab.htm#Preliminary_Process_Flow_Diagram" target="_popup">Preliminary Process Flow Diagram</MadCap:xref>).  The objective is to isolate the energy that comes from the disturbance type the system is set up to detect, from all the other energy that can excite the <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> sensor.</p>
                <p>The Detection Statistic Module applies sophisticated signal process techniques to the instantaneous power spectra, to compute an optimal Detection Statistic.  The Detection Statistic Module separates disturbance energy into five types of sub-classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analysis band</li>
                    <li>Signal intensity relative to the noise floor (strong or weak)</li>
                    <li>Temporal dynamics (persistent or impulsive)</li>
                    <li>Spatial extent (localized or non-localized)</li>
                    <li>Spectral shape (low frequency modeled, low frequency un-modeled or non-low frequency)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The output produced by Helios is based on a Kalman filter, which averages the power spectra to assist in the detection response from subtle low intensity disturbances. This utilises a two dimensional array of data, with distance on one axis, and time shown on the other axis.  For more information, refer to your training materials.</p>
                <p class="DeveloperQuery">&lt;Is this bad compared to competitors? I need to know so I can word it more appropriately, so it looks like a benefit rather than a drawback.&gt;</p>
                <p>Due to the nature of our pre-process algorithm, the time dimension of this array has been heavily decimated.  Helios only computes a single row of Detection Statistics for each FFT block that is processed.</p>
                <p>The exact rate at which output detection statistics are calculated is: </p>

                    <p class="cautionMiddle">The Detection Statistics Module consumes the most compute resources of all the modules.  For this reason, the number of simultaneous Active Detection Statistic templates should be kept to a minimum.  Typically, a persistent stream and an impulsive stream are computed in parallel.  For disturbances with different spectral content, a new Detection Statistic template can be created that only changes the Analysis Band.  As this process is at the tail end of the Processing flow, it will not add very much compute load to the system. </p>

                <h3><a name="Indicato"></a>Indicators...</h3>
                <p>This module is used to create an Indicator cleaning mask.  Indicator Cleaning Masks take raw indicators and attempt to remove false positive and false negative values that are not associated with the desired disturbance.</p>
                <p>The raw indicators are cleaned for distance, and then time.  Event sizes refer to distances in metres and Event durations refer to times in seconds.  It is important to remember the cleaning order, as it can explain why certain cleaning behaviour is observed.  The Indicators (Cleaning) dialog is shown below.

                <p>The output from the Streams Definition Module forms the input to the Alarm Reporting module.  Streams consist of a Detection Statistic template and an Indicator Mask (or Indicator Template).  In addition, the Detection Threshold used to convert the Detection Statistic into Raw Indicators is defined in the Streams dialog.  This is to allow a single Indicator Mask to be re-used with multiple Detection Thresholds.  A detection statistic template and Indicator Mask <b>MUST</b> exist before a Stream can be defined.  You have to select an optimal Detection Threshold to create the raw indicators, as well as select an input Detection Statistic template and Indicator Mask.  If there is no Indicator Mask, refer to <MadCap:xref href="indicator_properties.htm#top" target="_blank">Indicator Properties</MadCap:xref>. Below is the Streams Dialog, refer to <MadCap:xref href="0concept_user_temp_props_streams.htm#top" target="_blank"> User Template Properties (Streams)</MadCap:xref> to see a description of the information that goes in each field.

                <h3><a name="Alarm"></a>Alarm Reports...</h3>
                <p>The Alarm Reporting Module determines if a valid alarm should be generated.  This happens when cleaned indicators meet the criteria that have been defined, in order, from the:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>	Basic Tracking</li>
                    <li>Alarm filters</li>
                    <li>Enabled, high-level rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than use the cleaned indicators from a single Stream, the cleaned indicators from a number of Streams can be combined together with Boolean logic and then sent to the Alarm Report decision logic.</p>
                <p>If more than one stream of indicators is required, they are combined; a Boolean AND operation is used for this.  If more than one stream of indicators is disallowed, they are first combined with a Boolean AND operation, and then removed from the required indicator streams.</p>
                <p>This is because, all of the required streams <b>MUST BE</b> present, and none of the disallowed streams can be present.  For an example, refer to your training materials.  The basic Stream selection and Tracking properties of the Alarm Reporting module are shown below.
