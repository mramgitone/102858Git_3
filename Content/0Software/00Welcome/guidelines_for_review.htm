        <h1 class="ChapterTitle" MadCap:autonum=" Chapter 1: ">Guidelines for Reviewers: (To be Deleted)</h1>
        <p>Before you start, please note:</p>
        <p class="TechAuthorNotes">Technical Author notes to the Reviewers (Everyone)&#160;will be in green. They’re also the basis for reminders to Claire.</p>
        <p class="DeveloperQuery">If Claire has a direct developer query, it will be in purple, so please look out for those too, as it may just apply to certain sections.</p>
        <p>Links to be put in will be highlighted in <span style="background-color: #ff0000;">Red </span>(for external links to files) and <span style="background-color: #1e90ff;">sky blue</span>&#160;(for internal Help file links).</p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #ff1493;">{Picture ...}</span> defines where Claire needs a screen shot. She may also have added notes as to what she needs to do with callouts. Claire can take her own screen shots but if we are pushed for time or there is no access available to a box, then please take one for her.</p>
        <p>However.... if anything is <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">highlighted in yellow</span>, then I’m not sure if it is to be included or not and I&#160;will have prompted you to answer my query.</p>
        <p>If you want to call Claire, she’s on Skype. Skype ID is claire_fotech or ex 238 in the Church Crookham office.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" 1.1. ">Images</h1>
        <p><b>Please open each image to check that the call outs are correct.</b> Annotate where necessary, if Contributor doesn’t give you an option to add/edit text. It would be nice to find out if you think the size of the thumbnails and original images needs altering. Thumbnails are set at default 48 &amp;&#160;96px, to take into account that there can be a lot of room taken up by images, and that more experienced users will probably not use the images as much. An example of a thumbnail can be seen in the next section “Conditional Tagging”. </p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" 1.2. ">Conditional Tagging</h1>
        <p>Conditional tags have been added to some sections where users will see differences, depending upon which user level they are granted to log-in. A list of the existing tags is in the image below. One for Panoptes may also be included at some point in the future.</p>
        <p class="image">

        </p>
        <p>Conditional tags in Flare are used to “Exclude” highlighted sections from a user’s view. A lot of the tags are set so that the View Only user will not see the content. Where more than one level of user shouldn’t see content, a patterned background will be seen e.g. Basic &amp;&#160;Admin users background will look speckled (see below).</p>

        </p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" 1.3. ">Related Topics Control</h1>
        <p>At the bottom of each page should be a “Related Topics” link. Where you see this link please check to see that all topics that should be linked are included in the list. If you think there is an item that needs adding, please highlight it in the review. You can add an annotation, as the Related Topics Control is a Flare control and may only be available to the Technical Author.</p>
