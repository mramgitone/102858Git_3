        <p class="DeveloperQuery">We will have to test whether this should all be put into the one topic and condition tagged or whether snippets should be used, so information is reused. At present, we’ve played with the Get Started and View Only Display information, but at present the Display info is split over 3 topics so that all we had to do was condition tag the user level folder. Please advise whether you’d like me to put all Display Information together in one topic or whether software environment constraints mean I should keep the structure as is.</p>

        <p>This is the Administrator Login Display.

If you are logged in as an Administrator, you will see the <MadCap:xref href="../0Software/2Admin Tasks/0concept_admin_menu.htm#top" target="_popup">Admin Menu</MadCap:xref> in addition to the <MadCap:xref href="../0Software/1View Only Tasks/0concept_main_menu.htm#top" target="_popup">Main Menu</MadCap:xref>, which will have additional functionality (refer to What’s New). </p>

                <h2>Data Logging Controls</h2>
                <p>Data logging management is located to the right of your dashboard and allows the user to log to one of three different formats. HDF5 and NetCDF4 are common formats which work with many third party tools. FDS (Fotech Data Stream) is our proprietary format designed to allow maximum write speeds.The user can log the raw data of either the full <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> line or a section of the <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> line to any of these three formats. Those data files can then be used in Playback mode. Additionally the user can log the current <MadCap:variable name="General.Fibre/Fiber" /> Graph (the display type). These files cannot be used for playback (as they do not contain the full raw data) but can be imported into other tools for analysis. </p>
                <Div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: Black;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatSize&quot;&gt;NOTE:&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
                    <p class="noteMiddle">The <MadCap:variable name="General.Fibre/Fiber" /> Graph logging always logs the entire monitored portion of the <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" />. </p>
                </Div>
                <p>These controls let you control how you mount a disk drive (see <MadCap:xref href="../0Software/2Admin Tasks/fit_data_drive.htm#top" target="_popup">How to fit a Data Drive</MadCap:xref>), set the data logging properties (presumably you need a section describing the data logging properties) and <a href="../0Software/2Admin Tasks/fit_data_drive.htm#Start" target="_popup"><MadCap:xref href="../0Software/2Admin Tasks/fit_data_drive.htm#Start" target="_popup">Start Data Logging</MadCap:xref></a>. To do this, go to the relevant section and complete the tasks. The disk drive <b>MUST&#160;BE</b> mounted before logging can begin.</p>
