        <h3><a name="Alarm"></a>Alarm Report Tab</h3>
        <p>The Alarm Reports tab controls defines which Alarm Reports are generated by the system, see the image below. </p>

        <p>Alarm Reports are then submitted to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> clients, and optionally to Panoptes servers or 3rd party interfaces. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName2" /> controllers are typically shipped with at least one pre-configured Alarm Report. However, streams need to be created and associated with an Alarm Report, to activate the Alarm Reports option. For more information about how to create a stream, refer to your training materials and<MadCap:xref href="streams_properties.htm#top" target="_popup"> Streams Properties</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatSize&quot;&gt;NOTE: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">If you have a Panoptes server connected to your system, refer also to <MadCap:xref href="hardware_properties.htm#Reportin" target="_popup">Reporting</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>An Alarm Report can be created, even if you do not want to generate and submit an Alarm Report for that stream.  During the initial property tuning stage, it is also common to create an Alarm Report but not submit it.  If these types of Alarm Reports are created, the system will not be flooded with reports.</p>
        <Div class="Caution" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff3800;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatSize&quot;&gt;CAUTION!&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p class="cautionMiddle">To have multiple active Alarm Reports implies that multiple streams are processed in parallel. This can increase the compute load.  Care <b>MUST BE</b> taken to activate the Alarm Reports, one at a time, to monitor the increase in compute load and prevent a system overload.  

If necessary, perform some data decimation.  </p>
            <p class="cautionMiddle">Refer to the <MadCap:xref href="#Spatial">Spatial decimation factor</MadCap:xref>  for more information about how to reduce the compute load on the Helios system.

        <p>Below are instructions to create, activate and remove Alarm Reports. When this section has been completed, refer to <a href="hardware_properties.htm" target="_blank">Hardware Properties</a> to set-up the initial properties for the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />System.</p>

                <h4><a name="Create"></a>Create an Alarm Report</h4>
                <p class="para">An Alarm Detection determines if the response is from a desired disturbance, and if so generates the appropriate Alarm Report.  Additional logic performs most of the actual disturbance classification and nuisance rejection work. For the system to generate an Alarm Report, you need to make sure an Alarm Report is selected. To do this, one or more Alarm Reports, with the associated streams, detection statistic templates and alarm cleaning templates, must exist. Most Helios systems will be shipped with a set of non-editable factory templates that can be used to start alarm generation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To create an Alarm Report, you need to check the list of stream templates, and if you need to create a new Alarm Type, refer to <MadCap:xref href="streams_properties.htm#top" target="_popup">Streams Properties</MadCap:xref> for instructions.</li>
                    <li>Then check and configure the settings to be shown in the Alarm Report. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="0concept_admin_menu.htm#Detectio" target="_popup">Detection Statistics</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
                    <li>To activate or remove an Alarm Report, refer to <a href="#How2">How to activate an Alarm Report</a> and <a href="#How">How to remove Alarm Reports</a> respectively.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4><a name="How2"></a>How to Activate an Alarm Report</h4>
                <p>Alarm Reports are listed by name. When an Alarm Report is created, it must be made active. To do this: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the check box next to the Alarm report to be submitted. </li>
                    <li>Select the <b>Submit alarms</b> check box. This configures the system to generate and submit the Alarm Report. </li>
                    <li>To make it easier to submit Alarm Reports, make sure the <b>Submit alarms</b> check box is selected. </li>
                    <li>Enable each of the Alarm Reports that the system has configured to report on. To do this repeat Steps 1 to 3. To remove an Alarm Report, refer to <a href="#">How to remove Alarm Reports</a>.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4><a name="How3"></a>How to suppress Alarm Reports</h4>
                <p>During system tuning, you can get many false alarms in your alarm reports. You can suppress the submission of these false alarms to the rest of your engineering system, which can also speed up the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. To do this see the image below and complete these steps:</p>

                </p>
                <p class="captionCont" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1-2: ">The Alarm Report Tab</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check that the <b>Submit alarms</b> option is not checked. This allows you to  create alarm types and monitor their stream detection and indicator display values, whilst not flooding the system.</li>
                    <li>Once you have tuned the system, select <b>Submit alarms</b> to turn alarm detection back on again.</li>
                </ol>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <h4><a name="How"></a>How to remove Alarm Reports</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to remove Alarm Reports:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select each individual Alarm Report and then deselect the check box for each Alarm Report.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Clear All</b> link at the bottom of the Alarm Report tab, to clear all active Alarm Reports.</li>
        </ul>
