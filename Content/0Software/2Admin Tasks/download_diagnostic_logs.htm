        <h4><a name="top"></a>Download Diagnostic Logs</h4>
        <p>If you have to report a problem with the Helios system, it helps the customer support team if current diagnostic information is available and sent to them.  To download the Diagnostic logs:</p>
        <p>Select <b>Admin &gt; Download Diagnostic Logs</b>.  This will download a compressed Linux tar file (<code>*.tar</code>) to your <i>Downloads</i> folder, unless the browser is configured to save files elsewhere. This file also contains a number of diagnostic log files and additional system configuration files.</p>
        <p>Attach the downloaded tar file to an email addressed to <a href="mailto:customer.support@fotechsolutions.com?subject=Report of a Diagnostics Problem" target="_blank">customer.support@fotechsolutions.com</a>. Include with the file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	A description of the problem.</li>
            <li>	How it happened.</li>
            <li>Any steps you have taken to resolve the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes, Technical Support can ask you to confirm the Optics Type, refer to <MadCap:xref href="optical_channel_properties.htm#Optics" target="_popup">Optics Tab</MadCap:xref> for more information, and if necessary  <MadCap:xref href="../1View Only Tasks/0concept_main_menu.htm#Report" target="_blank">Report a problem...</MadCap:xref>.</p>
