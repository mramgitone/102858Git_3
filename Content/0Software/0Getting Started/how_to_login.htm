        <h1><a name="top"></a>How to Log-in</h1>
        <h2><a name="Types"></a>Types of User</h2>
        <p>There are three types of user defined in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Most of the time your level of access will be predetermined. The types of user are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="../1View Only Tasks/0concept_view_only_functions.htm#top">Basic user</a>. This login is for someone who can only view events as they happen. This person will see the waterfall display only.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="../2Admin Tasks/0concept_administrator_functions.htm">Administrator</a>. This login is for someone who is an operator of the system and allows them to manage events as they happen and also to create and amend user logins.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="../3Factory User Tasks/0concept_factory_user_functions.htm">Factory user</a>. This login is reserved for Fotech Employees only. Only in special circumstances are these details given to a client. This login allows the database to be wiped and resets the system to  its factory settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Log-in"></a>Log-in Instructions</h2>
        <p class="TechAuthorNotes">I&#160;could do with some screenshots for this section please</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To login, go to the IP address given in your datasheet.</li>
            <li>Select the level of user you want to log in as.</li>
            <li>Enter your user ID and password.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser">Login as an Operator (System Administrator)</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser">Helios Controllers are all shipped with a pre-installed user account called Admin. The first time you log into Helios, you <b>MUST </b>use this account.</p>
        <Div class="Note" MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: Black;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatSize&quot;&gt;NOTE:&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">
            <p class="noteMiddle" MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser">During the login procedure, never select the <b>Remember this User</b> option, as it will interfere with the login authentication process.</p>
        </Div>
        <p MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser">To access this account:</p>
        <ol MadCap:conditions="HELIOS_HWI.BasicUser">
            <li>Choose the<b>Main Menu &gt; Access Secure Pages</b>option.</li>
            <li>Enter the password, which you will find on the Datasheet provided to you during the installation process.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="What"></a>What if my Username and Password do not work?</h2>
        <p>Once a username is created it cannot be changed, so it is likely that it is a problem with the password.  If the combination of your <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> does not work, report this to your System Administrator so your password can be reset.</p>
        <p>In the event that you are the Operator or Factory User, <a href="mailto:customer.support@fotechsolutions.com?subject=Notification of Operator or Factory User Log-in Issues" target="_blank" title="Notification email of Log-in issue" alt="Notification email of Log-in issue">contact us</a>.</p>
        <h2>Operations Dashboard</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:xref href="../1View Only Tasks/0concept_view_only_display.htm#top" target="_blank">The View Only Display</MadCap:xref> will display information that is dependant on the level of access to the system you have. </p>
