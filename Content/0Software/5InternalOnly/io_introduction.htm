        <p>This section is used by Fotech Engineers &amp;&#160;Customer Support <b>ONLY</b>. It is not to be included in any end-user material outputs. Conditional tags are applied to this section to make sure it is not output and displayed to clients.</p>
        <p>Over time, it is hoped that this section will be padded out with general and user specific information, applicable to the certain Fotech engineer support duties conducted during projects, and include links to knowledge bases, user community management, etc.</p>
