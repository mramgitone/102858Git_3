            <MadCap:concept term="Introduction" />Introduction</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameShort" />) is a web-based application that monitors real-time information from vibration disturbances along the distance of a Helios Distributed Acoustic Sensor installation. Optical <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" />s can run up to 40km, and provide information to operatives in a variety of industries. This information can be used independently or with our proprietary alarm management server, Panoptes.</p>
        <p>The workstation can be connected directly to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName2" /> system, or can be connected via a LAN or a WAN.  This allows for both local and remote <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName2" /> surveillance and control. </p>
        <h1>Principle of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName2" /> Controller takes the raw backscattered light from the <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> sensor due to an acoustic disturbance and transforms it into detailed knowledge about the time, location and type of disturbance.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameShort" /> displays the controller’s response to a variety of alarm disturbance types, and can display alarms when a particular disturbance has been detected that meets a number of alarm criteria.  The sophisticated disturbance alarm module has been designed to ignore nuisance alarms while it continues to alarm accurately  on disturbance types of interest.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameShort" /> supports simultaneous configuration of detection and multiple alarm types that can produce a number of display outputs, designed to allow users to fine tune and optimise the system’s response.  A full suite of diagnostic capabilities has been incorporated into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameShort" /> to notify users immediately of any irregularities in the system’s operation.  System log and parameter files can be easily downloaded to the user’s local computer in order to understand more fully the system’s operational characteristics.</p>
        <p>Not only can <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameShort" /> display the live <MadCap:variable name="General.fiber/fibre" /> response of the system, but it can also instruct the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName2" /> Controller to record to disk the raw system response and then have it played back with the use of a Playback module.  This feature allows for an accurate fine-tuned set of system parameters and settings that can provide improved alarm detection capabilities. </p>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p>All you need is a modern web browser. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is supported by Google Chrome (Windows®) and Safari (Mac&#160;OS® &amp;&#160;Windows®). However, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer® is not supported.</p>
