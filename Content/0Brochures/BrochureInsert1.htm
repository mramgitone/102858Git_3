        <p><big>H</big>elios DAS converts a single optical <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" /> into the equivalent of tens of thousands of highly-sensitive vibrational sensors. Using a standard single mode telecommunications cable that is deployed in-well or connected to a linear asset Helios monitors vibration disturbances along optical <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" />s up to 40km. It provides dynamic real-time information to operatives in a variety of industries and can be used independently or with our proprietary alarm management server, Panoptes.</p>
        <h1>Principle of DAS</h1>
        <p>As an advanced variant of Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) instrumentation, Helios monitors the Rayleigh backscatter noise signature that is fine structured in the backscatter signature of the <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" /> optic cable. Helios is optimized to measure small changes in the coherent Rayleigh noise structure that occurs from pulse to pulse and very small physical (acoustic or vibration) disturbances at a point in the <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" /> can make detectable changes in the interferometric signal. </p>
        <p>The Helios interrogator detects simultaneous acoustic disturbances along the entire <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" /> to provide real-time information that details the time, location and types of disturbance.</p>
        <h1 class="ListItem">Features</h1>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Simple to install as an operation is being developed or retrospectively on existing infrastructure</li>
            <li>Low deployment cost, it operates with standard telecommunication grade optical <MadCap:variable name="brochure.fibre/fiber" />s</li>
            <li>Lower “through life” maintenance costs</li>
            <li>Requires no power along the entire sensor length beyond the interrogator unit. The system is immune to EM and RF interference</li>
            <li>User friendly system configuration and alarm handling software that enables a high degree of tuning and simple integration with client management systems</li>
        </ul>
